# Blockchain Based image storage system

There are a lot of documents and licenses which are very important for us, and we can be needing them at any time. So we can build a secure platform with the help of blockchain which can ensure that our documents are safe and easy to access. This system works in the following way:

The user will upload their documents to the Blockchain system.

The government or any system that requires documents submission access them from the Blockchain with the required permissions from the user.

This system if implemented would lead to secure, paperless, and quick transactions and would be convenient to the users as well as the government.
